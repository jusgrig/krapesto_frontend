Learn the art of authentic Neapolitan pizza making with our experienced chefs. This hands-on workshop will introduce you to the true essence of Neapolitan pizza — from its rich history to traditional techniques used by professionals in Italy.

During the session, you will discover how authentic pizza dough is made, learn the correct proportions and ingredients, and understand why ingredient quality is essential to achieving the perfect result. Our chefs will guide you through the history of Neapolitan pizza, its traditions, and the rules that define this world-famous culinary heritage.

In the practical part of the workshop, you will be taught how to properly shape the pizza base by hand, how to combine ingredients to preserve authentic flavors, and how to prepare your pizza for baking. Each participant will have the opportunity to slide their own handcrafted pizza into the oven and experience the excitement of true Neapolitan pizza baking.

This experience is ideal for families, groups of friends, and pizza lovers who want not only to taste authentic pizza, but also learn how to create genuine Italian flavors themselves.
